# ✅ Small Todo Site
A full-stack Todo application that lets users log into their accounts and manage their daily tasks. Users can add, edit, and complete todos throughout the day. At the end of the day, all completed tasks are cleared — no more deleting tasks one by one, helping you stay focused on your goals.

The app also features:
- A dynamic progress bar that updates as you complete tasks.

- A small date widget — a gentle reminder of what day it is when you're deep in the zone.

## ✨ Technologies
React

JavaScript

Tailwind CSS

Vite

node.js

express

MongoDB atlas

## 🚀 Features
- user authentication - Secure login/logout functionality to keep each user's todos private

- task management - simple ui allows the user to add, edit and delete tasks with ease

- progress bar - keeps the user motivated to complete their tasks for the day

- date diaplay - shows the current date as a subtle reminder — helpful when you're deep in work.

- persistent storage - todos are saved to database so they persist between sessions


## 📍 The Process
I've been on a mission to learn react and I thought there is no way better to learn than to do projects! What started as your simple avarage todo starter project gradually became more interesting. I decided to store all the todos in a database so that it wouldn't
reset everytime the page refreshes, which i used MongoDB to do so, I was able to implement this after many failed attemps because I had no experience in databases - but eventually it worked. As I am interested in cybersecurity I thought it would be interesting to
try to implement a authentication system where users log into their accounts to see their todo - hiding other users todos from every other user. This may have turned out to be a quite complex 'begginner' project, but I think it turned out quite good.
